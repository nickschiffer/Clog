 * Description:

 * Parameters:
 * - message:
 *    - Type: char *
 *    - Description: A string message with format specifies included. This functions similarly to
 *    the format specifier string passed into functions like printf, fprintf, etc.
 * - (...):
 *    - Type: char *
 *    - Required: false
 *    - Description: One or more values of any type which correspond to the format specifier(s) in 
 *    the message string.
 * 
 * Notes:
 * - It is recommended that you use these functions as they are explicit about the severity of the 
 * log message while saving you a parameter.
 * - Just like functions such as printf, fprintf, etc, if your optional arguments don't match your 
 * format specifiers, or vice versa, the behavior is undefined and can result in garbage output.

 * Description:

 * - rollover: A soft cap on the maximum number of bytes the file that filename refers to
 * - filename: The name of the log file to write to
 * 
 * Notes:
 * - Using the initialization, load, reset, and getter/setter functions below, you probably won't 
 * need to declare an instance of this if you're just doing simple console or single-file  
 * logging. However, if your use-case is more complex, a useful pattern would be declaring multiple 
 * instances of this struct with different settings as needed, and loading them into clog's internal
 * log properties struct when relevant.
 * - For log rollover, if you have for example a file named "text.log" with rollover set to 2048, 
 * this will act as a "soft cap" on the maximum number of bytes the log file can be before 
 * rollover. If a logging call is made with a message that, when added to the file, would exceed 
 * this value, ClLog will:
 *    - Add the message to "text.log" as the final entry for that file.
 *    - Attempt to change the file's name to "text.log.1", appending the extra ".1". This will 
 *    succeed if it is the first time the log has rolled over, however if it has already rolled 
 *    over in the past, then there will already be a file with that name, in which case it will 
 *    increment the number it is trying to append to ".2" and so on.
 *    - Call fclose() on the internal file pointer and open a new file with the original filename 
 *    specified, using this for all future logging messages until the next rollover occurs.

 *    each message. The available specifiers are:
 * - %c*
 *    - Name: Text Color
 *    - Description: Indicates that any text following this specifier, until the Text Reset 
 *    specifier is found, should be of the color specified by the asterisk (*). The asterisk can be 
 *    any of the following:
 *        - k/K: Black/Bright Black
 *        - r/R: Red/Bright Red
 *        - g/G: Green/Bright Green
 *        - y/Y: Yellow/Bright Yellow
 *        - b/B: Blue/Bright Blue
 *        - m/M: Magenta/Bright Magenta
 *        - c/C: Cyan/Bright Cyan
 *        - w/W: White/Bright White
 * - %r
 *    - Name: Text Reset
 *    - Description: Disables any previously set text modifiers, including Text Color.
 * - %t{*}
 *    - Name: Time
 *    - Description: Any type of time-related text represented by strftime()'s specifiers, 
 *    specified here as an asterisk (*). The contents of the curly braces get passed to strftime() 
 *    as its format string, while the curly braces are consumed by the internal parsing function.
 * - %l
 *    - Name: Level
 *    - Description: Severity level of the message.
 * - %F
 *    - Name: Filename
 *    - Description: The name of the file that the message was generated in.
 * - %L
 *    - Name: Line
 *    - Description: The line number in the file that the logging message was generated in.
 * - %f
 *    - Name: Function
 *    - Description: The function in the file that the logging message was generated in.
 * - %p
 *    - Name: Process ID
 *    - Description: The process id of the process in which the log message was generated.
 * - %m
 *    - Name: Message
 *    - Description: The string(s) passed by the user as the actual message of the log entry.
 *
 * Notes:
 * - If the character that immediately follows a percent sign in the string isn't a valid 
 * specifier, that percent sign and its following character are interpretted literally.
 * - For a Text Color specifier, the actual color character should directly follow the specifier. 
 * For example, "%cG" indicates that all text that follows it should be Bright Green, until the 
 * Text Reset specifier is encountered. If no Text Reset specifier is encountered, all of the text 
 * that follows it would be Bright Green. If the color character that comes after the specifier is 
 * not a valid color character, the specifier is instead interpretted literally.
 * - For a Time specifier, an opening and closing curly brace should immediately follow the 
 * specifier, with the intent that anything in between them be passed to strftime(). For example, 
 * "%t{%Y-%m-%d}" would translate to "YYYY-MM-DD", or the year, month, and day of the logging 
 * message. Documentation on valid specifiers for inside of the curly braces can be found in any 
 * <time.h> documentation that supports it. If no closing curly brace is ever found, the specifier 
 * and opening curly brace are interpetted literally.
